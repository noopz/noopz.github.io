<p>If you share our content through social media, for example by liking us on Facebook, following or tweeting about us on Twitter, or leaving a comment via a social network, those social networks will record that you have done so and may set a cookie for this purpose.</p>
<p>In some cases, where a page on this website includes content from a social network, such as a Twitter feed, or Facebook comments box, those services may set a cookie even where you do not click a button.
